Here are some detailed rules regarding each element.</p> <p><code>Prefix</code> and <code>Suffix</code> are to be determined by the asset type through the following Asset Name Modifier tables.</p> <p><code>BaseAssetName</code> should be determined by a short and easily recognizable name related to the context of this group of assets. For example, if you had a character named Bob, all of Bob's assets would have the <code>BaseAssetName</code> of <code>Bob</code>.</p> <p>For unique and specific variations of assets, <code>Variant</code> is either a short and easily recognizable name that represents logical grouping of assets that are a subset of an asset's base name. For example, if Bob had multiple skins these skins should still use <code>Bob</code> as the <code>BaseAssetName</code> but include a recognizable <code>Variant</code>. An 'Evil' skin would be referred to as <code>Bob_Evil</code> and a 'Retro' skin would be referred to as <code>Bob_Retro</code>.</p> <p>For unique but generic variations of assets, <code>Variant</code> is a two digit number starting at <code>01</code>. For example, if you have an environment artist generating nondescript rocks, they would be named <code>Rock_01</code>, <code>Rock_02</code>, <code>Rock_03</code>, etc. Except for rare exceptions, you should never require a three digit variant number. If you have more than 100 assets, you should consider organizing them with different base names or using multiple variant names.</p> <p>Depending on how your asset variants are made, you can chain together variant names. For example, if you are creating flooring assets for an Arch Viz project you should use the base name <code>Flooring</code> with chained variants such as <code>Flooring_Marble_01</code>, <code>Flooring_Maple_01</code>, <code>Flooring_Tile_Squares_01</code>.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"styleguide/#11-examples","title":"1.1 Examples","text":""},{"location":"styleguide/#11e1-bob","title":"1.1e1 Bob","text":"Asset Type Asset Name Skeletal Mesh SK_Bob Material M_Bob Texture (Diffuse/Albedo) T_Bob_D Texture (Normal) T_Bob_N Texture (Evil Diffuse) T_Bob_Evil_D"},{"location":"styleguide/#11e2-rocks","title":"1.1e2 Rocks","text":"Asset Type Asset Name Static Mesh (01) S_Rock_01 Static Mesh (02) S_Rock_02 Static Mesh (03) S_Rock_03 Material M_Rock Material Instance (Snow) MI_Rock_Snow"},{"location":"styleguide/#12-asset-name-modifiers","title":"1.2 Asset Name Modifiers","text":"<p>When naming an asset, use these tables to determine the prefix and suffix to use with an asset's Base Asset Name.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"styleguide/#121-most-common","title":"1.2.1 Most Common","text":"Asset Type Prefix Suffix Notes Level / Map Should be in a folder called Maps.

If the artist who created the assets used material instances based on <code>Content/MaterialLibrary/M_Master</code> as they're instructed to, when a migration is performed there is a great chance of conflict for the previously migrated <code>Content/MaterialLibrary/M_Master</code> asset.</p> <p>This issue can be hard to predict and hard to account for.
